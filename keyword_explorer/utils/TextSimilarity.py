The military is using this rule in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it is pushing for its use in the US as well.
According to reports, in 2007, US troops killed more than 1,100 civilians in Iraq. None of these incidents were investigated because the US military simply declared them "combat deaths" or "enemy kills."
In 2010, the US Department of Defense reported that there were over 5,000 attacks on US forces in Afghanistan by "insurgents". According to the same report, there was only one civilian death for every 10.''',

Terrorism is a catch-all term that justifies any kind of violence by those who use it as a justification for their own actions. It's not a word that should ever be used lightly.

This is exactly what happened in Iraq. The US, UK and Australia are not signatories to the International Criminal Court (ICC), so they are not legally obliged to abide by its provisions. The ICC was established in 2002 as a court of last resort with a mandate to prosecute those who commit genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. It can only prosecute those who have been ratified by their home countries, the US being a notable exception.

However, the CCTV footage showed that the young man was just walking at a distance from the soldiers and wasn't carrying any kind of knife. He was shot and killed without any apparent reason.

US troops were ordered not to fire on the looters during the early days of the war. I guess you can see why we lost control of the country so fast. Saddam's mercenaries and Fedayeen had orders to shoot at any American soldier who was armed and in uniform, but not to shoot at any American soldier wearing civilian clothes.
